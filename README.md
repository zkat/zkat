### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kat!

I'm a polyglot developer, and I do a ton of open source work. I've been doing this for a while and a lot of folks use the stuff I've helped make.

These days, I mainly do Rust and JavaScript/TypeScript/HTML/CSS, and occasionally some Elixir because of Phoenix. I also work at Microsoft on the TypeScript tooling team (mainly Visual Studio tooling, tsserver, etc).

You can also find me on Mastodon as <a href="https://toot.cat/@zkat" rel="me">@zkat@toot.cat</a>, on BlueSky as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zkat.tech" rel="me">@zkat.tech</a>, on Matrix as <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@zkat:matrix.org" rel="me">@zkat:matrix.org</a>, on Signal as <a href="https://signal.me/#eu/UbWiug2I-0BKm6BLL5lAlGUgLCnU0FfH_TDYboITrBqECfuUKB9K54DxVhxqWAWf" rel="me">@nyankat.13</a>or on Discord as `zkat__`.
